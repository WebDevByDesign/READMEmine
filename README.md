# READMEmine ‚úçüèº

## Description
READMEmine is a README generator, that presents the User with a series of questions, which will serve as the backbone of the new README.md file. Once all questions have been answered, the system will generate a README.md file, for the current project the User is working on.

I initially built this as a school project, but also find it an extremely useful and time saving tool! Instead of copy and pasting from a side template README file I created in the past, I can now simply run "npm start" in the integrated terminal of the project, and wala - README.md generated!
